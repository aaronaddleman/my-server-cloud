* `openstack['endpoints']['orchestration-api-cloudwatch-bind']['bind_interface']` - The interface name to bind the-cloudwatch service to

If the value of the 'bind_interface' attribute is non-nil, then the service will be bound to the first IP address on that interface. If the value of the 'bind_interface' attribute is nil, then the service will be bound to the IP address specifie>

Miscellaneous Options
---------------------

Arrays whose elements will be copied exactly into the respective config files (contents e.g. ['option1=value1', 'option2=value2']).

* `openstack["orchestration"]["misc_heat"]` - Array of bare options for `heat.conf`.
* `orchestration_auth_encryption_key` - Key used to encrypt authentication info in the database. Length of this key must be 16, 24 or 32 characters. Comes from secrets databag.
